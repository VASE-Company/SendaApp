# Stitch Prompt — Senda Portfolio (Professional Build)

Use Gemini 3.1 (or highest available quality mode) to generate a production-grade web design system and page set.

## Objective
Convert the imported Stitch concepts into a **professional, cohesive, conversion-ready website** for Senda Portfolio.

## Non-negotiables
- Keep strict monochrome editorial style (black/white/grayscale only).
- No warm accents (no yellow/gold/brown/beige/orange/sepia).
- Avoid AI-template repetition.
- Every page must be visually related but compositionally different.

## Deliverables (6 pages)
1. Home Hero (asymmetric editorial composition)
2. Portfolio Gallery (curated masonry)
3. Project Detail (storytelling + metadata)
4. About (authorial portrait + manifesto)
5. Services (premium pricing composition, non-generic)
6. Booking (minimal, high-conversion form)

## UX Requirements
- One primary CTA per block.
- Strong hierarchy (type, spacing, contrast).
- Clear navigation and page-to-page continuity.
- Mobile-first behavior and polished desktop.

## Motion Guidelines
- Subtle scroll reveal
- Stagger cards/content
- Light hero parallax intention
- Smooth section transitions
- No flashy gimmicks

## Implementation Intent
Output should be cleanly transferable to Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion + GSAP, with reusable sections and coherent tokens.
